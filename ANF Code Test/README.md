#  Abercromie and Fitch Code Test Submission

I have made the following changes in this branch:

Fixed the bug with the TableView controller and refactored the app to use the MVVM Design Pattern with the help 
of Combine Framework. I also created a networking class to populate the screen with the data from the Abercrombie API provided in the project description. 

I switched the architecture to MVVM because it allows greater flexibility in terms of scaling, helps make the code more reusable, and is great for testing. 
I am also using the Combine Framework to do the networking to demonstrate the use of combine and write cleaner code.
